Too long, didn't read
You get a list of integers, and you have to write a function mirror that returns the "mirror" (or symmetric) version of this list: 
i.e. the middle element is the greatest, then the next greatest on both sides, the the next greatest, and so on...


function arithmeticSequenceElements(a,r,n) {
    let arr = [a];
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
      arr.push(arr[i] + r);
    }
  
  return arr.join(', ');

}
