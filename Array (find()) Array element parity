In this Kata, you will be given an array of integers whose elements have both a negative and a positive value, except for one integer that is either only negative or only positive. Your task will be to find that integer.
Examples:
[1, -1, 2, -2, 3] => 3
3 has no matching negative appearance

function solve(arr){
  return arr.find(el => arr.indexOf(-el) === -1);  
};
